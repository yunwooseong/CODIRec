# [Under review] All Items are not Equal: Addressing the Imbalance of Item Knowledge in LLM for Recommendation


We propose CODIRec, a novel approach designed to address the imbalance in item information and enhance recommendation performance. The proposed CODIRec applies a contrastive decoding strategy to effectively supplement information and guide the model away from inaccurate predictions. The proposed method is implemented during the inference stage.
